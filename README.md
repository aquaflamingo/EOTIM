# Ethereum Open Transaction Insurance Market (EOTIM)

PoC for an p2p open market for insuring escrow based transactions on the blockchain. 

Let's say you're making a shipment from Mexico to Vancouver for oranges 📦🍊. 

You might want to have some insurance on that... 👨🏻‍

Okay probably not 🤦. But this was just a fun project to learn a little bit more about Truffle, Dapps and React.Js.

## Building

1. Clone repo
2. `cd eotim && npm install`
3. Download testrpc, run `testrpc`
4. `npm run start`
5. http://localhost:3000
6. ???
7. Profit??? 

## TODO
(It's a wip okay 😆)

1. Fix `insure` method to accurately insure contracts 
2. Fix insured flags to present non-insured contracts
3. Pull user's deal contracts on dashboard
4. Search by name for contracts
